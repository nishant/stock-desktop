## Introduction

A desktop client to query stock data from Yahoo Finance, bootstrapped and
packaged with Angular 11 and Electron 12.

Currently runs with:

- Angular v11
- Electron v12
- Electron Builder v22

This application can be:

- Run in a local development environment with Electron & Hot reload
  - _Hot reload only pertains to the renderer process. The main electron process
    is not able to be hot reloaded, only restarted._
- Run in a production environment
- Packaged into an executable for Linux, Windows & Mac

Note: _Angular 11.x CLI needs Node 10.13 or later to work correctly._

<br>

## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishant/stock-desktop.git
```

Install dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

There is an issue with `yarn` and `node_modules` when the application is built
by the packager. Use `npm` as dependencies manager.

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular CLI , you **MUST**
install `@angular/cli` in npm global context. Follow Angular's
[documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a
previous version of `angular-cli`.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

<br>

## Building for Development

Run the start script to use the application local development environment with
hot reload.

```bash
npm start
```

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. The app runs with a simple Angular
App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.

You can disable "Developer Tools" by setting the boolean flag `openDevTools` to
`false` in `main.ts`.

<br>

## Running in Browser Mode

To execute the application in the browser with hot reload, run
`npm run ng:serve:web`.

Alternatively, the application can still run in-browser at
https://localhost:4200 even when `npm start` is used.

<br>

## Using Electron / NodeJS Libraries

This project runs in both web and desktop mode. To make this work, **you have to
import your dependencies the right way**.

Check `providers/electron.service.ts` to see how to conditionally import
libraries when using electron / NodeJS / 3rd party libraries in renderer context
(i.e. Angular).

<br>

## Using Third Party Libraries (Material, Bootstrap, etc)

3rd party libraries used in electron's renderer process (like angular material)
have to be added in `devDependencies` of `package.json`.

They are already added in the final package during webpack's compilation phase.
Otherwise, it will significantly increase the size of your final package.

<br>

## Using Specific Libraries in Electron Main Thread (rxjs, ngrx, etc)

Import your library in npm dependencies section (**not** devDependencies) with
`npm install --save`.

It will be loaded by electron during the build phase and added to your final
package.

Use your library by importing it in `main.ts`.

The application is optimized. Only the /dist folder and node dependencies are
included in the executable.
